 Team Routourist's Entry for Tiktok Hackathon 2023

https://tiktokhackathonchallenge2023.devpost.com/


 ## Features

 - A **For You Page** with a catalogue of products recommended just for you, along with flash deals and trending topics in Tribes
 - **Tribes**: Join like-minded shoppers in communities known as tribes, and create discussion posts on product reviews, enquires, recommendation, shopping guides and more
 - **Quests**: Participate in quests such as inviting friends onto the app and being an active member in a Tribe for Tiktok coins, which can be used to redeem discounts and cash rebates
- **Wishlist**: Share products that you really wish to buy with your friends and followers, and perhaps one of them might surprise you by buying you that product! And if you're feeling generous, fulfil a friend's wishlist in return
- **Gift Finder**: Not sure what to get for your friend? Choose the styles that your friend would like, and let Gift Finder recommend gifts for you!
